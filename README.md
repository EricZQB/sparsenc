Introduction
============
This project provides a C implementation (and a Python wrapper) for encoding/recoding/decoding of network coding. Random linear network coding (RLNC) [1] and several of its sparse variants are implemented. The library supports three catagories of sparse network codes (SNC): random codes, band codes and BATS-like codes [2].

The following decoders are implemented: 

- (sub)generation-by-(sub)generation (GG) decoder has a linear-time complexity but exhibits higher decoding-induced overhead.

- overlap-aware (OA) decoder has optimized code overhead but exhibits higher complexity.

- band (BD) and compact band (CBD) decoders that apply to band code only.

- PP(perpetual) decoder applies to decode the window-wrapped codes only.

The library had been used for performance evaluation and comparison when authoring the following papers. If you find the lib useful, please cite the papers when appropriate.

Usage
============
The library is available as a shared library which is compiled by

```shell
$ make libsparsenc.so
```

Accessing API is via `include/sparsenc.h`. 

Some examples are provided to test the codes and decoders (see examples/ directory). Run

```shell
$ make sncDecoders
```

and test using

```shell
usage: ./sncDecoders code_t dec_t datasize pcrate size_b size_g size_p bpc bnc sys
                       code_t   - RAND, BAND, WINDWRAP, BATS
                       dec_t    - GG, OA, BD, CBD, PP
                       datasize - Number of bytes
                       pcrate   - Precode rate (percentage of check packets)
                       size_b   - Subgeneration distance
                       size_g   - Subgeneration size
                       size_p   - Packet size in bytes
                       bpc      - Use binary precode (0 or 1)
                       bnc      - Use binary network code (0 or 1)
                       sys      - Systematic code (0 or 1)
```

Please note that currently only the OA decoder is tested for decoding the BATS code.

To test the code over example networks, run

```
$ make sncRecoders-n-Hop
```
for using random/band codes over an n-hop line network where intermediate nodes perform on-the-fly recoding, and 

```
$ make sncRecoderNhopBATS
```
for testing the BATS code over the n-hop line network.

Use

```
$ make sncRecoderFly
```
for sending the random/band codes over a butterfly network. Please see main functions under `examples/xxx.c` for details and `makefile` for other available examples.

Limitation
============
The library only supports coding against a given block of source packets, i.e., a *generation* of packets as termed in the network coding literature. Sliding-window mode is not supported. 

A sliding-window implementation, also known as streaming coding, is available as a separate project at: https://github.com/yeliqseu/streamc, which implementes coding schemes proposed in
