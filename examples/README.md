This folder contains example scripts which are used to evaluate encoding/decoding performance and to simulate various network coded transmission schemes. Some scripts are used to generate simulation results in the authors' research papers. For readers that are interested in re-produce and/or compare the results, we provide a correspondence between the scripts and the papers below. The readers are referred to the individual C files for details, which should be self-explained after reading the papers.
